# 🎓 HandGaze Training Guide

## 📋 Overview

This guide will help you train HandGaze to recognize your custom hand gestures. The training process is designed to be intuitive and efficient, ensuring high recognition accuracy.

## 🎯 Prerequisites

Before starting the training process, ensure you have:

- HandGaze installed with all dependencies
- A well-lit environment
- Your camera properly connected and working
- Python 3.9.3 - 3.11 installed (3.9.3 recommended)
- Sufficient space for gesture data storage

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Launch Training Mode**
   ```bash
   python gesture_trainer.py
   ```

2. **Initial Setup**
   - The trainer will create a `gesture_data` directory if it doesn't exist
   - Previous training data will be backed up automatically
   - The system will guide you through the training process

## 📝 Training Process

### Step 1: Gesture Selection
- Choose which gestures you want to train
- Default gesture set includes:
  - Letters (A-Z)
  - Special commands (SPACE, BACKSPACE)
  - Numbers (0-9)

### Step 2: Data Collection
For each gesture:
1. Position your hand in front of the camera
2. Hold the gesture steady
3. Follow the on-screen countdown
4. Multiple samples will be captured automatically
5. Verify the captured samples

```python
# Sample training sequence
for gesture in gestures:
    print(f"Training gesture: {gesture}")
    countdown(3)  # 3-second countdown
    capture_samples(5)  # 5 samples per gesture
    verify_samples()
```

### Step 3: Verification
- Review captured gestures
- Retrain any problematic gestures
- Test recognition accuracy

## ⚙️ Training Parameters

| Parameter | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Samples per Gesture | 5 | Number of samples collected per gesture |
| Capture Delay | 3s | Time between samples |
| Minimum Confidence | 0.5 | Minimum recognition confidence |
| Frame Resolution | 640x480 | Camera resolution during training |

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Custom Gesture Sets
```python
CUSTOM_GESTURES = [
    "THUMBS_UP",
    "PEACE",
    "ROCK_ON"
    # Add your custom gestures
]
```

### Training Settings
```python
TRAINING_CONFIG = {
    'samples_per_gesture': 5,
    'capture_delay': 3,
    'min_confidence': 0.5,
    'use_augmentation': True
}
```

## 📊 Quality Assurance

### Best Practices
1. **Lighting**
   - Ensure consistent lighting
   - Avoid harsh shadows
   - Use diffused light when possible

2. **Hand Positioning**
   - Keep hand within frame
   - Maintain consistent distance
   - Avoid rapid movements

3. **Sample Variety**
   - Include slight variations
   - Train from different angles
   - Consider different lighting conditions

### Validation
- Test each gesture after training
- Verify recognition accuracy
- Check for confusion between similar gestures

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Training Issues

1. **Poor Recognition**
   - Retrain with more samples
   - Ensure consistent lighting
   - Check hand positioning
   - Increase minimum confidence threshold

2. **Inconsistent Results**
   - Verify training data quality
   - Check for similar gestures
   - Ensure sufficient sample variety
   - Consider environmental factors

3. **System Performance**
   - Close unnecessary applications
   - Check system resources
   - Verify camera settings
   - Monitor CPU usage

## 🔄 Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Retrain periodically
- Update gesture data
- Monitor recognition accuracy
- Backup training data

### Data Management
```bash
# Backup gesture data
cp -r gesture_data gesture_data_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Clean old backups
find . -name "gesture_data_backup_*" -mtime +30 -delete
```

## 📈 Optimization Tips

1. **Recognition Accuracy**
   - Train in your usual environment
   - Include common variations
   - Use consistent gestures
   - Regular retraining

2. **Performance**
   - Optimize sample count
   - Balance accuracy vs. speed
   - Monitor system resources
   - Regular cleanup of old data

## 🎮 Quick Reference

### Key Commands
- `SPACE`: Skip current gesture
- `R`: Retrain current gesture
- `ESC`: Exit training mode
- `S`: Save current progress

### Gesture Guidelines
- Keep gestures distinct
- Maintain consistent form
- Avoid complex movements
- Consider user comfort
